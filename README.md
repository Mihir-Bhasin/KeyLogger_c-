# KeyLogger_c++
This is the Basic source code illustrating keylogger functionality.
This Phishing Keylogger is a Trojan that downloads an executable file to windows which then creates a shortcut icon on your desktop and disguises itself as your default browser. Whenever you click the shortcut icon, the keylogger will create a hidden file that will log everything from your keyboard and then open your default browser for you. As you are surfing the web everything your typing is saved in the key logged file, once you close the application the keylogger executable will stop and save the hidden file. Everytime you open a new browser the process repeats itself. I built the application with C++.

# Requirements:
1.g++ compilier
2.Windows Environment (Not compatiable with MacOS or Linux)
